# @corestack/tenancy

## 0.0.1

### Initial scaffold (E05-T01)

- Module scaffold only: package manifest, `createTenancyModule` factory
  (registers a purge subscription, a static health stub, no use cases yet),
  repository ports (`OrganizationRepository`, `MembershipRepository`,
  `InvitationRepository`), tenancy event contracts (types only, no
  publishing), `tenancyConfigSpec`, and a schema-only migration.
- No aggregates, no commands, no persistence, no HTTP interface. See the
  package [README](./README.md#what-is-intentionally-not-implemented) for
  the complete list of what this release deliberately does not include.
